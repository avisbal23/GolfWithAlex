# Master Build Prompt — GolfWithAlex (Single-Page iPhone Golf Score App)

Build a minimal, single-page, mobile-first golf scoring web app optimized for an iPhone in portrait (16:9). Everything must fit on one screen with no page navigation. Overlays/modals are allowed.

---

## 1. Core Concept
Track a golf round for 1–4 players with fast, tap-based scoring designed for real play on the course.

- No login
- No backend/database
- All state stored in browser memory + localStorage
- Offline-friendly

---

## 2. Layout (Single Page)

### Top Bar (always visible)
- App title text: GolfWithAlex
- Light / Dark mode toggle
- “?” Help button
- “View Current Score” button

### Pre-Round Setup (Hole 1 only, compact)
- Location input with autocomplete (Google Places or Mapbox; fallback to plain text if no key)
- Course Name (auto-fill from location if possible)
- Tees (dropdown/text: Tips, Blue, White, Red, Custom)
- Date (default today, editable)
- Select round length: 9 holes or 18 holes

### Main Scoring Area
Display 1, 2, 3, or 4 large clickable player boxes (tiles), one per player. Tiles auto-resize so all fit on screen.

Each player tile must include:
- Player name inside a clearly defined clickable name box (same tap target as the tile is fine)
- Current hole stroke count (large)
- Optional hint text: “tap +1 / hold -1” (can hide after first use)

### Bottom Controls
- Current hole indicator (e.g., “Hole 5 / 18”)
- Par? numeric input for the current hole
- Finish Hole button (alternative to swipe right)

---

## 3. Player Tile Interaction (Critical)
For each player tile (clickable box):
- Tap anywhere on the tile OR on the name box → +1 stroke
- Tap-and-hold anywhere on the tile OR on the name box → −1 stroke (min 0)
- Large tap targets for glove use
- Optional haptic feedback

### Dynamic color on the tile (live preview)
The player tile background or border must change color dynamically based on:
- The current Par? value for the hole
- The player’s current stroke count

If Par? is blank/undefined, use a neutral/default tile color.

---

## 4. Par-Based Color Logic (Use Everywhere)
For a given hole:

Par condition:
- strokes == par → Green
- strokes == par − 1 (birdie) → Gold
- strokes == par + 1 (bogey) → Yellow
- strokes == par + 2 (double bogey) → Medium Brown
- strokes >= par + 3 → Light Red

Apply this logic to:
- Live player tiles during the hole (dynamic)
- “View Current Score” grid cells
- Final scorecard grid cells
- Subtotal/total highlights (optional)

---

## 5. Swipe Navigation
- Swipe right anywhere in the scoring area → commit scores + advance to next hole
- Swipe left → go back to previous hole and restore scores/par
- Ignore vertical swipes
- Require a minimum swipe distance threshold to prevent accidents

---

## 6. Hole Completion Rules
When a hole is completed (Finish Hole button or swipe right):
- Save strokes for each player and the Par? for that hole
- Advance hole index
- Reset in-hole counters for the next hole (or load existing values if revisiting)

Special confirmations:
- Hole 9 completion → show Front 9 subtotal
- Hole 18 completion → show Round Complete + totals

---

## 7. “View Current Score” (Always Available)
A button visible at all times opens a modal/bottom-sheet overlay showing the full current score grid:

- Columns: holes 1–9 or 1–18
- Rows: players
- Cells show strokes for completed holes (blank for future holes)
- Apply par-based color logic when par exists
- Show totals per player
- Overlay is dismissible and non-destructive

---

## 8. Help “?” Modal (Always Available)
Persistent “?” button opens a modal with the following copy:
